<pre>
<mark>Events happen in HTML Elements. JavaScript can be used to react to those events </mark>
They generally follow the <mark>HTML DOM (Document Object Model)</mark>

<mark>HTML Events </mark>

An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does.

Here are some examples of HTML events:

    An HTML web page has finished loading
    An HTML input field was changed
    An HTML button was clicked

Often, when events happen, you may want to do something.

JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected.

HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to HTML elements.

With single quotes:
<element event='some JavaScript'>

With double quotes:
<element event="some JavaScript">

<mark>What can JavaScript Do? </mark>

Event handlers can be used to handle, and verify, user input, user actions, and browser actions:

    Things that should be done every time a page loads
    Things that should be done when the page is closed
    Action that should be performed when a user clicks a button
    Content that should be verified when a user inputs data
    And more ...

Many different methods can be used to let JavaScript work with events:

    HTML event attributes can execute JavaScript code directly
    HTML event attributes can call JavaScript functions
    You can assign your own event handler functions to HTML elements
    You can prevent events from being sent or being handled
    And more ...
