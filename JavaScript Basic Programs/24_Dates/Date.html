<pre>
By default, JavaScript will use the browser's time zone and display a date as a full text string:

Wed Jul 10 2019 17:21:27 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time)

You will learn much more about how to display dates, later in this tutorial.
Creating Date Objects

Date objects are created with the new Date() constructor.

There are 4 ways to create a new date object:
1) new Date()

2) new Date(year, month, day, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds)

Note: This method can have reduced number of parameters but only trailing parameters are allowed to be removed.
Also, if only one parameter, next Date() format is selected.

3) new Date(milliseconds)

4) new Date(date string)

new Date()

new Date() creates a new date object with the current date and time:
Date objects are static. The computer time is ticking, but date objects are not.

<script>
//document.write(Date());
var d = new Date();
document.write(d);
