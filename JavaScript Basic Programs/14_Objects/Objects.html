<mark><b>JavaScript Objects</mark></b>

You have already learned that JavaScript variables are containers for data values.
Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.

The values are written as name:value pairs (name and value separated by a colon).

JavaScript objects are containers for named values called properties or methods.

<mark><b>Object Definition</mark></b>

You define (and create) a JavaScript object with an object literal
Spaces and line breaks are not important. An object definition can span multiple lines:

<mark><b>Object Properties</mark></b>

The name:values pairs in JavaScript objects are called properties

<mark><b>Accessing Object Properties</mark></b>

You can access object properties in two ways:

objectName.propertyName

or

objectName["propertyName"]

<mark><b>Object Methods</mark></b>

Objects can also have methods.

Methods are actions that can be performed on objects.

Methods are stored in properties as function definitions.
A method is a function stored as a property.

<mark><b>The this Keyword</mark></b>

In a function definition, this refers to the "owner" of the function.


In other words, this.firstName means the firstName property of this object.

<mark><b>Accessing Object Methods</mark></b>

You access an object method with the following syntax:
objectName.methodName()If you access a method without the () parentheses, it will return the function definition

<mark><b>Do Not Declare Strings, Numbers, and Booleans as Objects!</mark></b>

When a JavaScript variable is declared with the keyword "new", the variable is created as an object
Avoid String, Number, and Boolean objects. They complicate your code and slow down execution speed.
