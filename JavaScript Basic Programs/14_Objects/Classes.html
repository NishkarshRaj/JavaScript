We have seen creation of Objects.
But we have never created the Template Class till now.
Are they even present in JS???
Let's check if we can create a object using an already created object using new keyword here.
Note: We are assuming that the objects we create are classes with constructors initializing their values.

PS: It's not working :(

<script>
//Creating General Object as a Class
var cls = 
{
name : "sfs",
age : 25
};
document.write(cls.name + " " + cls.age);
var obj = new cls();
document.write(obj.name + " " + obj.age);
obj.name = "Nishkarsh";
obj.age = 20;
document.write("Hello ");
document.write(obj.name + " " + obj.age);
</script>
</body>
