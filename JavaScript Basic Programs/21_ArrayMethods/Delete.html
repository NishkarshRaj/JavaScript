<pre>
Since JavaScript arrays are objects, elements can be deleted by using the JavaScript operator/keyword delete.
Using delete may leave undefined holes in the array. 
Use pop() or shift() instead.

<mark> Unlike pop() or shift(), it does not removes indexed element and reduces size of array but just replaces value with undefined.
But one advantage is that pop or shift does not work in non-boundary elements.</mark>

<script>
var arr = [1,23,25,62,53];
delete arr[2]; //25
document.write(arr); //shows nothing until accessed by for loop then undefined.
</script>
