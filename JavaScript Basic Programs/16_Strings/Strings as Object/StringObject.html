<pre>
Normally, JavaScript strings are primitive values, created from literals:

var firstName = "John";

But strings can also be defined as objects with the keyword new:

var firstName = new String("John");
Don't create strings as objects. It slows down execution speed.
The new keyword complicates the code. This can produce some unexpected resultsNote the difference between (x==y) and (x===y).
Comparing two JavaScript objects will always return false.

<mark>
Three reasons never to use String Objects:
1) Increases Complexity
2) Slows down speed
3) Incomparable strings even if they are same because belong to different object.
