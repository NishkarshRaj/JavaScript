<pre>
Many programming languages support arrays with named indexes.

Arrays with named indexes are called associative arrays (or hashes).

JavaScript does not support arrays with named indexes.

In JavaScript, arrays always use numbered indexes.  

WARNING !!
If you use named indexes, JavaScript will redefine the array to a standard object.
After that, some array methods and properties will produce incorrect results.

<script>
var arr = []; //valid declaration of array when empty array at start
arr["name"] = "Nishkarsh"; //Using names rather than index as in objects
document.write(arr.length + "<br>" + arr[0] + "<br>" + arr["name"]); //+ "<br>" + arr); this wont print anything
</script>
