<pre>
To label JavaScript statements you precede the statements with a label name and a colon:
label:
statements

The break and the continue statements are the only JavaScript statements that can "jump out of" a code block.

Syntax:
break labelname;

continue labelname;

The continue statement (with or without a label reference) can only be used to skip one loop iteration.

The break statement, without a label reference, can only be used to jump out of a loop or a switch.

With a label reference, the break statement can be used to jump out of any code block
A code block is a block of code between { and }.

<script>
var arr = ["My","name","is","Nishkarsh","Raj","Khare"];
var i = 0;
var out = "";





//Problem here. I am trying to create a loop like structure using break,continue and label. Logic is there but it just does not give output
//Logic:
//Increment i till arr length and then break out of loop
//Until false, continue again from label.
l1:
{
out = out + arr[i] + " ";
i++;
//document.write(i);
if(i==arr.length)
{
break l1; 
}
continue;
}










document.write(out);
