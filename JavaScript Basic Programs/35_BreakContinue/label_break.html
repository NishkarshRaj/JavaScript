<pre>
To label JavaScript statements you precede the statements with a label name and a colon:
label:
statements

The break and the continue statements are the only JavaScript statements that can "jump out of" a code block.

Syntax:
break labelname;

continue labelname;

The continue statement (with or without a label reference) can only be used to skip one loop iteration.

The break statement, without a label reference, can only be used to jump out of a loop or a switch.

With a label reference, the break statement can be used to jump out of any code block
A code block is a block of code between { and }.
