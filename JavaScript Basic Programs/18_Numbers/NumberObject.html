<pre>
Normally JavaScript numbers are primitive values created from literals:

var x = 123;

But numbers can also be defined as objects with the keyword new:

var y = new Number(123);

Do not create Number objects. It slows down execution speed.
The new keyword complicates the code. This can produce some unexpected results:

When using the == operator, equal numbers are equal
When using the === operator, equal numbers are not equal, because the === operator expects equality in both type and value.

<script>
var x = 41;
var y = new Number(41);
document.write((x==y) + "<br>" + (x===y));
</script>
