<pre>
JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values.

<mark><b>JavaScript Identifiers</mark></b>

All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.

These unique names are called identifiers.

Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

    Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
    Names must begin with a letter
    Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
    Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)
    Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names

JavaScript identifiers are case-sensitive.

<mark><b>The Assignment Operator</mark></b>

In JavaScript, the equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator.

This is different from algebra. The following does not make sense in algebra:
x = x + 5
<mark><b>They will cancel out and will result in 0=5 which is wrong</mark></b>

In JavaScript, however, it makes perfect sense: it assigns the value of x + 5 to x.
The "equal to" operator is written like == in JavaScript.

<mark><b>JavaScript Data Types</mark></b>

JavaScript variables can hold numbers like 100 and text values like "John Doe".

In programming, text values are called text strings.

JavaScript can handle many types of data, but for now, just think of numbers and strings.

Strings are written inside double or single quotes. Numbers are written without quotes.

If you put a number in quotes, it will be treated as a text string.

<mark><b>Declaring (Creating) JavaScript Variables</mark></b>

Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable.
After the declaration, the variable has no value (technically it has the value of <mark><b>undefined(keyword)</mark></b>).
It's a good programming practice to declare all variables at the beginning of a script.

<mark><b>One Statement, Many Variables</mark></b>

You can declare many variables in one statement.

Start the statement with var and separate the variables by comma
Value = undefined

In computer programs, variables are often declared without a value. The value can be something that has to be calculated, or something that will be provided later, like user input.

A variable declared without a value will have the value undefined.

<mark><b>Re-Declaring JavaScript Variables</mark></b>

If you re-declare a JavaScript variable, it will not lose its value.

The variable carName will still have the value "Volvo" after the execution of these statements

<mark><b>JavaScript Arithmetic</mark></b>

As with algebra, you can do arithmetic with JavaScript variables, using operators like = and +
You can also add strings, but strings will be concatenated
