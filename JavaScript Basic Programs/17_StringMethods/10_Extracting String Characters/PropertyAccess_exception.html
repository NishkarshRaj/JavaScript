<pre>
<mark> String are Immutable and thus even though we can access their character by [] we cannot modify it.</mark>



Property access might be a little unpredictable:

    It does not work in Internet Explorer 7 or earlier
    It makes strings look like arrays (but they are not)
    If no character is found, [ ] returns undefined, while charAt() returns an empty string.
    It is read only. str[0] = "A" gives no error (but does not work!)

var str = "Nishkarsh Raj Khare";
str[10] = "A";
document.write(str);
