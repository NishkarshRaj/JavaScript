Primitive values, like "John Doe", cannot have properties or methods (because they are not objects).

But with JavaScript, methods and properties are also available to primitive values, 
because JavaScript treats primitive values as objects when executing methods and properties.

Thus, String methods are applicable basically for String Objects but are allowed to work on Primitive Strings as well.
As shown in example below, the methods convert String to object to work on them but return String type only.

All string methods return a new string. They don't modify the original string.
Formally said: Strings are immutable: Strings cannot be changed, only replaced.
