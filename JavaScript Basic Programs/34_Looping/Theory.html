JavaScript Loops

Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.
Different Kinds of Loops

JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:

    for - loops through a block of code a number of times
    for/in - loops through the properties of an object
    for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object
    while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
    do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
