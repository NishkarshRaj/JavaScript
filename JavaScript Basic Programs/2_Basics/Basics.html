Hello!!! Using a script without function implies script is always called and used as defined!!!
</pre>
<pre>
In HTML, JavaScript code must be inserted between script and /script tags.Old JavaScript examples may use a type attribute: script type="text/javascript".
The type attribute is not required. JavaScript is the default scripting language in HTML.

A JavaScript function is a block of JavaScript code, that can be executed when "called" for.

For example, a function can be called when an event occurs, like when the user clicks a button.

You can place any number of scripts in an HTML document.

Scripts can be placed in the body, or in the head section of an HTML page, or in both.
Placing scripts at the bottom of the body element improves the display speed, because script interpretation slows down the display.
Scripts can also be placed in external files

External scripts are practical when the same code is used in many different web pages.

JavaScript files have the file extension .js.

To use an external script, put the name of the script file in the src (source) attribute of a script tag

You can place an external script reference in head or body as you like.

The script will behave as if it was located exactly where the script tag is located.

External scripts cannot contain script tags.

Placing scripts in external files has some advantages:

    It separates HTML and code
    It makes HTML and JavaScript easier to read and maintain
    Cached JavaScript files can speed up page loads
